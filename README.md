# IC_Autom_BS
 A tool to automatically ruin your perfect Briv

Code stolen from IdleCombos with permission. Thank you Eldoen!


This is crude and ugly and as a bonus if you press X to close it, it goes to tray and continues to run. I don't give much care to this one, because it's like a toilet of a train. It just works.
I do not recommend you to use it, but if you do know what you are doing, go for it.

Press update to update inventory
Choose champ id to use bs contracts on (look at help/champ id's or use 58 Briv, 75 He-Man)
Press start
Close the script by pressing exit button, not X.
Or if you press X you can close the script from system tray, or pulling the plug of your computer. Hope you're not on laptop.

It will update inventory every 2 minutes, and use all bs contracts every 30 minutes.
