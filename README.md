 A tool to automatically ruin your perfect Briv</br>

This is crude and ugly and as a bonus if you press X to close it, it goes to tray and continues to run. I don't give much care to this one, because it's like a toilet of a train. It just works.</br>
I do not recommend you to use it, but if you do know what you are doing, go for it.</br>
</br>
Press update to update inventory</br>
Choose champ id to use bs contracts on (look at help/champ id's or use 58 Briv, 75 He-Man)</br>
Press start</br>
Close the script by pressing exit button, not X.</br>
Or if you press X you can close the script from system tray, or pulling the plug of your computer. Hope you're not on laptop.</br>
</br>
It will update inventory every 2 minutes, and use all bs contracts every 30 minutes.</br>
